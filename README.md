This is a beginning python exercise.

The program anagram_prog_1.py reads the letters from
the command-line and combines them with the dictionary
file '/usr/share/dict/words' to generate a list of anagrams
where each word is at least 3 letters.

$ time ./anagram_prog_1.py president trump > presidential_anagrams

Maybe 20 minutes later you have ~250,000 anagrams including
['pint', 'rust', 'permed']
